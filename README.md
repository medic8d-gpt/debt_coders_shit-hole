# Random Site (personal)

This repo holds a simple static site. Drop HTML files into the root or the `pages/` folder and assets (images, css, js) in `assets/`.

To preview locally:
- Open `index.html` in your browser, or run a simple server:
  - Python (Windows): `python -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000`

Deploy options:
- GitHub Pages: push to `main` and enable Pages from the repository settings (root).
- Netlify: connect the repo and set publish directory to `/` (or use drag-drop).

I can add exact deploy steps for GitHub Pages or Netlify â€” tell me which.
